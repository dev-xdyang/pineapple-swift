[Pineapple Lang](https://github.com/karminski/pineapple) written by Swift

# Description

Pineapple Lang is a simple programming language demo. It includes a hand-written recursive descent parser and a simple interpreter, although the language is not even Turing-complete. But this repo's main goal is to give beginners of compilation principles a warm up and a simple look at how a programming language is built.

# How to run

```terminal
$cd pineapple-swift
$swift run pineapple-swift
pen pineapple apple pen.

```
